<h2>Aaron Irizarry</h2>
<h5>Designing a Culture of Design</h5>
<p>Workplace culture doesn&#8217;t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge,<br> and it doesn&#8217;t end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It&#8217;s the unwritten rules,<br> behavior, beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to get done, or <br>it&#8217;s what stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel <br>valued, we need to work in a culture that embraces design and allows it <br>to succeed.</p>
<p>In Aaron&#8217;s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that<br> *get* design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, <br>and companies have that others don&#8217;t, and more importantly, how to begin to <br>change your own workplace&#8217;s culture. Once you&#8217;ve worked within a culture of <br>design it&#8217;s almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.</p>
<h5 style="color: rgb(118, 121, 121);padding-top: 20px;">About Aaron</h5>
<p>Aaron Irizarry is a Senior Product Designer for Nasdaq OMX, a lover of heavy<br> metal, a foodie, and a master of BBQ arts.

<h2>Adam Connor</h2>
<h5>Lights! Camera! Interaction! Design Inspiration from Filmmakers</h5>
<p>Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a <br>combination of well-written narrative and effective storytelling technique. It&#8217;s the<br> filmmaker&#8217;s job to put this together. To do so they&#8217;ve developed processes, tools <br>and techniques that allow them to focus attention, emphasize information, <br>foreshadow and produce the many elements that together comprise a well-told <br>story.</p>
<p>With this workshop, we&#8217;ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on <br>the technical aspects used in film to communicate. We&#8217;ll look at some tools used in <br>film, such as cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We&#8217;ll consider why <br>they&#8217;re used and how we might look to them for inspiration.</p>
<h5>About Adam</h5>

As an Experience Design Director with<br> Mad*Pow, Adam combines 10+ years of experience in interaction and experience<br> design with a background in computer science, film, and animation to create <br>effective and easy-to-use digital products and services.

<h2>Bermon Painter</h2>
<h5>Death to Wireframes: Long Live Rapid Prototyping</h5>
<p>Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process. Prototyping makes<br> things a little better by allowing you to stitch together static wireframes or mockups<br> while adding basic interactions. Rapid prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript <br>is even better and faster; it increases collaboration and improves the iteration<br> process. Kill your wireframes. Long live rapid prototyping.</p>
<h5>About Bermon</h5>
<p>Bermon is the organizer of various community groups for user experience<br> designers and front-end developers, and the organizer of Blend Conference, a <br>three-day, multi-track event for user experience strategists, designers and<br> developers. He also leads the user experience team for Cardinal Solutions&#8217; <br>Charlotte office, where he consults with large enterprise clients on interesting <br>problems across user experience, design and front-end development.</p>
